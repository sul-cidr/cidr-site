# Workshops @ CIDR

During the three primary quarters of the academic year, CIDR offers hands-on workshops on tools and methods for data science and digital scholarship. We regularly hold introductory and intermediate workshops on Python and R, along with workshops on basic machine learning methods and data visualization. Our workshops are designed for humanities and social science scholars, using examples from those fields. We also design and run workshops on a range of digital scholarship methods and concepts for numerous campus communities.

Upcoming workshops will be listed below, and you can also [subscribe to the cidr-announce mailing list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cidr-announce) to receive notifications about upcoming CIDR workshops. Many of our workshop materials are available in our [Workshops GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sul-cidr/Workshops/).
